# tipo

tipo is an example project mimicing the basic functionality of topi. The purpose is to have a limited set of functionality where different implementations can be tested, focusing on DI and consequences.

## Feature Set
Following use cases should be implemented:
- As a seller I want to create an offer for a customer.
- As a customer I want to view an offer.
- As a customer I want to be able to accept an offer.
- As a customer I want to be able to see my devices. 

For the sake of simplicity authorisation is not part of the project.
